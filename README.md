# baby time

## Stuff to buy

Sarong
Battery tea candles

## Some things to consider

Yoga / exercise before pregnancy.

Post natal yoga classes (6 weeks after birth)

Newborn first aid - check out online courses?

Breast-feeding for our baby - wednesday nights and maybe from 35 weeks.

## Active birth

We have OPTIONS - all rooms have a bath so Jo can have a water birth if she wants.

Use your BRAIN (benefits, risks, alternatives, intuition, not now, later?).

## Baby dropping!

Around the 37 week mark and the baby moves down the pelvis. Jo will goto
the bathroom more as the baby's head moves on top of the bladder.

Cervix will shorten and open up.

3% of babies present in breach. If North Shore Hospital cannot flip the baby,
they will not perform a vaginal birth when in breach (caesarian only).

## Hospital time

### Packing

Two bags - labour bag and a hospital stay bag.

* Yoga mat - WON'T NEED?
* Music - maybe alexa
* Fox laptop + charger
* Phones!
* Can bring some board games? Maybe one board game.
* Massage ball (green one).
* Snacks so that we have lots to eat!

Check Fox's email as she's missing a few things like a booklet with some important info from the email attachment.

### Early phase

Walking and light exercise is good. Can happen at any time!

At 10 minutes between contractions, we should consider calling the birthing
unit.

Contractions might do the 5-1-1 thing.

5 minute intervals lasting 1 minute for over 1 hour.

It's important to focus on relaxation for Jo fox.

### Transition phase

Really intense phase of contractions where final dialation occurs. Midwife
should be there as soon as mum wants to push.

Can be very emotional. I need to support Jo 100% here and attend to whatever.

### During labour

* Consider pulling the blinds down or dimming the lighting in the rooms.
* Mellow and relaxed space.
* TENS massage electrode (early through active stage) which causes pins and
needles and cuts off some pain feeling through labour. Need to hire in advanced
* Sterile water injection - direct injection to under skin into your back for
pain relief. Repeat injections are possible. Really good for lower back pain.
Can't be used in conjuction with any water things (shower) or hot packs on
back. Also a bit uncomfortable.
* Laughing gas is available for Fox, but not bear. Good for early phase of
labour. Not good for actual labour as Fox needs to focus.
* Morphine is available for Fox. It can cause nausea though so they give a
second injection to help with that. Makes people drowsy. Jo does not want.
* Epidural - I should do more research. Injected into the spinal cord and
contains an opiod + anesthesia.

During transition, we should call the midwifes immediately.

#### Second stage contractions


### Baby's head comes out (crowning)

Episiotomy - small incision (cut) to assist the baby coming out. Perineum cut.
Requires Fox to be stitched up afterwards. Saves fox from tearing more and is
considered the best place to cut.

Recovery time is longer (just like for a general tear). Some rehab is required.
Physiotherapy, pelvic floor muscle exercises. Should improve blood supply to
area to assist with healing.
