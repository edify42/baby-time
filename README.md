# baby time

## Stuff to buy

Sarong
Battery tea candles


## Some things to consider

Yoga / exercise before pregnancy.

Post natal yoga classes (6 weeks after birth)

Newborn first aid - check out online courses?

Breast-feeding for our baby - wednesday nights and maybe from 35 weeks.

## Active birth

We have OPTIONS - all rooms have a bath so Jo can have a water birth if she wants.

Use your BRAIN (benefits, risks, alternatives, intuition, not now, later?).

## Baby dropping!

Around the 37 week mark and the baby moves down the pelvis. Jo will goto
the bathroom more as the baby's head moves on top of the bladder.

Cervix will shorten and open up.

3% of babies present in breach. If North Shore Hospital cannot flip the baby,
they will not perform a vaginal birth when in breach (caesarian only).

## Hospital time

### Packing

Two bags - labour bag and a hospital stay bag.

Check Fox's email as she's missing a few things like a booklet with some important info from the email attachment.



### Early phase

Walking and light exercise is good. Can happen at any time!

At 10 minutes between contractions, we should consider calling the birthing
unit.

Contractions might do the 5-1-1 thing.

5 minute intervals lasting 1 minute for over 1 hour.

### Transition phase

Really intense phase of contractions where final dialation occurs. Midwife
should be there as soon as mum wants to push.

Can be very emotional. I need to support Jo 100% here and attend to whatever.



### During labour

* Consider pulling the blinds down or dimming the lighting in the rooms.
* Mellow and relaxed space.
